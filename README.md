# FANCY-CALCY
This repository contains the source code of my fully functional simple calculator project
Here I've used a basic HTML, with section tag for calculator outline and button tags of each button in calculator.
The basic mathematical operations can be done using this calculator. 
The operations available are Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo operation(provides remainder).
I've desinged every buttons and overall background using CSS
The operations have been done using JavaScript.
